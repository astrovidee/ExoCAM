Supported modifications in ExoCAM
  all modifications are colleted in the file ../SourceMods/src.share/exoplanet_mod.F90
  These must be changed prior to building the model.  Please see the file for
  more details and documentation.  Below is an incomplete list of options,
  some are self-explanatory.  

  Run options:
  do_exo_synchronous  --> force synchronous rotation for tidally locked planets

  Planet parameters:
  exo_planet_radius
  exo_surface_gravity
  exo_ndays  -- length of day scaler used for synchronous rotating worlds
  exo_eccen  -- orbital eccentrivity
  exo_obliq  -- orbitl obliquity
  exo_mvelp  -- vernal equinox
  ( the user is encouraged to confirm that their orbital configuration is
  behaving properly by examining the temporal evolution of the incoming solar
  radiation )

  Stellar options:
  exo_scon   -- solar flux recieved by the planet
  exo_solar_file -- path to the spectral energy distribution file

  Atmospheric Constituents:
  exo_n2bar  -- partial pressure of N2
  exo_h2bar  -- partial pressure of H2
  exo_co2bar -- partial pressure of CO2
  exo_ch4bar -- partial pressure of CH4
  ( it is the users responsibility to make sure these selections are paired
  with correct radiative transfer, and that the total pressure matches with
  the initial condition file, ncdata )


Fun Features
  do_exo_rt_clearsky  -- do parallel clearsky radiative calculation, used for
  determining cloud forcing; include fluxes with "C" appended in user_nl_cam 
  finidat for clearsky fluxes  (i.e. FUSC, FULC, FDSC, FUSC)

  do_exo_rt_spectral  -- compute spectrally resolved radiative fluxes; include
  binned spectral fluxes in user_nl_cam finidat (i.e 'FUS_int01','FUS_int02', etc)


ExoRT Radiative Transfer Packages
  src.n68equiv   == As of September 2020, this is the recommended version to use for all cases
                 == Correlated-k coefficients produced with HELIOS-K (Grimm et al. 2015)
                 == H2O, HITRAN 2016, Voigt lineshape, 25 cm-1 cutoff, plinth remove
                 == H2O Self and Foreign Continuum from MT_CKDv3.3 fit to gauss pts
                 == CO2, HITRAN 2016, Perrin and Hartmann (1989) subLorentzian
                         lineshape, 500 cm-1 cutoff, with CO2-CO2 CIA
                 == CH4, HITRAN 2016, Voigt lineshape, 25 cm-1 cutoff
                 == N2-N2, N2-H2, H2-H2 CIA downloaded from HITRAN
                 == CO2-H2, CO2-CH4 CIA from Turbet et al. (2020)
                 == 68 spectral intervals, 8 gauss points
                 == gas overlap using equivalent extinction absorption method (Amundsen et al. 2016)
                    In each spectral interval, grid box, and time, the
                    "major" gas is selcted and treated with an 8-gauss
                    point correlated-k distribution.  Minor species are
                    then added in as grey absorbers.  Major gases are
                    selected on the fly.
                 == Pressures from 10 bars to 0.01 mb
                 == Temperatures from 100 K to 500 K
  src.n84equiv   == Same as n68equiv, except spectral bins are extended
                    shortward of ~0.2 microns.  Use this for F-dwarf SEDS

  src.n28archean == H2O, CO2, CH4, N2, H2, HITRAN 2004, 28 bins, designed for
                    the Archean Climate (formerly "highco2")
                 == CO2 up to several tenths of a bar with an N2 background, CO2
                    accuracy less at higher values (not up-to-date CIA)
                 == CH4 up to 0.01 bar with an N2 background

                 == up to 100 bar total pressures
                 == N2-N2, N2-H2, H2-H2 CIA
