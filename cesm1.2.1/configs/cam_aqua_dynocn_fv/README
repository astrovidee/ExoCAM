QuickStart Guide :: cam4_aqua_dynocn_fv
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
description:        basic configuration
physics:            cam4
surface type:       dynamic ocean aquaplanet
dynamical core:     finite volume
radiation scheme:   user selected from ExoRT/3dmodels


The primary build featured here is a for an aquaplanet.  Due to numerical
idiosyncracies in the POP2 ocean model, the grid polar points must be covered
by land.  Thus our aquaplanet has stick continents covering a couple degrees
around the north and south poles.  

Changing the planet's topography/bathymetry is an involved process, utilizing
the NCAR Paleotool Kit.

However, dealing with the Paleotool Kit is one of Dante's seven circles of
hell.  You have been warned!!

See also ExoCAM/idl_progs/topobathy.pro for a simple idl script for defining
topography and boundary conditions.


== create the case
create_newcase -case $my_aquaplanet_case_name -res f45_45 -mach discover -compset B_2000

== set levels, physics, and the ExoRT radiative transfer package
xmlchange CAM_CONFIG_OPTS="-nlev 40 -phys cam4 -usr_src $EXORT_PATH/ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.n******"

== set domain file from xml command
xmlchange
LND_DOMAIN_PATH=$EXOC_PATH/ExoCAM/cesm1.2.1/initial_files/cam4_land_fv
xmlchange LND_DOMAIN_FILE=domain.lnd.fv4x5_landplanet.nc
xmlchange RTM_MODE=NULL  ; turns off river routing





== transfer files
copy SourceMods folder directly into your $Case directory
copy namelist files into your $Case directory

== finish
build and run

NOTES:
$EXORT_PATH is the path	where ExoRT is located

for instance... 
on Summit; $EXORT_PATH = /projects/wolfet/models
on Hyak;   $EXORT_PATH = /suppscr/vsm/gscratch/wolfet
on Discover; $EXOC_PATH = $EXORT_PARTH = /gpfsm/dnb53/etwolf
