QuickStart Guide :: circumbinary
description:        complete model for circumbinary planets 
physics:            cam4
surface type:       mixed (ocean/land)
dynamical core:     finite volume
radiation scheme:   src.cam.n28archean 

Notes: Contains all elements of the model build for circumbinary planets.  The
radiation scheme is included in SourceMods here. Thus it is NOT
interchangeable with other ExoRT/3dmodels

copy SourceMods folder directly into your $Case directory
copy namelist files into your $Case directory
build and run

NOTES:
$EXORT_PATH is the path	where ExoRT is located

for instance... 
on Summit; $EXORT_PATH = /projects/wolfet/models
on Hyak;   $EXORT_PATH = /suppscr/vsm/gscratch/wolfet
on Discover; $EXOC_PATH = $EXORT_PARTH = /gpfsm/dnb53/etwolf
