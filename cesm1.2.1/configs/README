    --  must link external radiative transfer options from ../ExoRT/3dmodels

2)  cam_aqua_se   
    --  aquaplanet, slab ocean, se cubed sphere dynamical core, cam4/5 phys
    --  must link external radiative transfer options from ../ExoRT/3dmodels

3)  cam_land_fv  
    --  land planet, finite volume dynamical core dynamical core, cam4/5 phys
    --  must link external radiative transfer options from ../ExoRT/3dmodels

4)  cam_mixed_fv
    --  continents + slab ocean, finite volume dynamical core, cam4/5 phys
    --  must link external radiative transfer options from ../ExoRT/3dmodels

5)  circumbinary
    --  continents + slab ocean, finite volume dycore, cam4 phys
    --  src.n28archean radiation included in SoureMods

6)  experimental 
    -- contains sub folders of experimental configurations
    -- not for public consumption, unless you are interested in 
    -- helping with development and testing 

-- add ons --

1)  carma 
     --  hook up for CARMA for cloud and aerosol treatments
     --  currently works with ../ExoRT/3dmodels/src.cam.n28archean.haze

NOTES: 
"aqua" models contain src.cice and src.docn SourceMods files, used for
modifying component sea ice and slab ocean models.  Land files are omitted.

"land" models contain src.clm SourceMods files, used for modifying land
component model.  Ocean and sea ice files are omitted.

"fv" models use the finite volume dynamical core and src.cam directory
contains modified files specfic to this scheme.

"se" models use the spectral element dynamical core on a cubed sphere grid,
and  src.cam directory contains modified files specfic to this scheme.
